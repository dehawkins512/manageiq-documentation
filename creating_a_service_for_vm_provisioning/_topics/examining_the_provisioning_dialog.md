## Examining the Provisioning Dialog

Understanding provisioning dialogs is important when working with
services in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}. Every provider in
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} comes with a sample provisioning dialog covering
the options specific to that provider. The process begins with the
provisioning dialog, which presents the basic configuration options for
a virtual machine or instance. The options presented are dependent on
the provider you are using. For instance, a cloud provider might have
flavors of instances, whereas an infrastructure provider might allow you
to set the memory size or number of CPUs on a virtual machine.

To see the sample provisioning dialog for Red Hat Virtualization:

1.  Browse to menu: **Automation > Automate > Customization**.

2.  Expand the **Provisioning Dialogs** accordion and select **Sample
    RedHat VM Provisioning Dialog** under **VM Provision**.

This is a textual representation of the dialog you will get when you
provision a virtual machine.
