### Running Reports

There are two different ways to generate a report: by scheduling the
report, or running the report manually by clicking the report generation
button on the **Reports** page. {{ site.data.product.title_short }} uses interactive report
generation so that reports are placed on a queue. A visual indicator of
the reports status is shown. All reports are automatically saved so that
they can be downloaded and analyzed later.
