### Editing an Action

Edit an action to modify its properties. You cannot edit any of the
default actions supplied with {{ site.data.product.title }}. Only actions that you
create can be changed.

Note that when you view an action, you can see what policies it has been
assigned to.

1.  Navigate to menu:Control\[Explorer\].

2.  Click the **Actions** accordion, then click on the action you need
    to edit.

3.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**),
    ![image](../images/1851.png) (**Edit this Action**) on the detail view
    of the action.

4.  Make any required changes.

5.  Click **Save**.

The action is modified and can be added to a policy. If the action is
already party of a policy, the policy is automatically updated.
