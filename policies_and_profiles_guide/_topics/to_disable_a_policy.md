### Disabling a Policy in a Policy Profile

You can disable one policy in a profile without removing it from the
policy, perhaps for trouble shooting purposes or because the policy is
not required temporarily.

1.  Navigate to menu:Control\[Explorer\].

2.  Click the **Policies** accordion, then navigate to the policy that
    you need to disable or navigate to the policy from the policy
    profile.

3.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**),
    ![image](../images/1851.png) (**Edit Basic Info, Scope, Notes**).

4.  Uncheck **Active**.

5.  Click **Save**.
