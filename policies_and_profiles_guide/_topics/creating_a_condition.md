### Creating a Condition

You can create a condition either from within a policy screen or by going directly to the expression editor in the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} console. You need to define a description and an expression element. The expression element defines what criteria you want to use to test the condition.

1. Browse to menu: **Control > Explorer**.

2. Click the **Conditions** accordion, and select either **Host / Node Conditions** or **VM and Instance Conditions** or **Replicator Conditions** or **Pod** or **Node Conditions** or **Image Conditions**.

3. Click ![image_1847](../images/1847.png) **Configuration**, then ![image_1862](../images/1862.png)**Add a New Host / VM / Replicator / Pod / Node / Image Condition**.

4. Enter a **Description** for the condition.

      - Click **Field** to create criteria based on field values.

        ![image_1888](../images/1888.png)

      - Click **Count of** to create criteria based on the count of something, such as the number of network adapters on the host.

      - Click **Tag** to create criteria based on tags that are assigned to your resources. For example, you can check the power state of a virtual machine or see whether it is tagged as production.

      - Click **Find** to seek a particular value, and then check a property. For example, finding the Admin account and checking that it is enabled. Use the following check commands:

          - **Check Any**: The result is true if one or more of the find results satisfy the check condition.

          - **Check All**: All of the find results must match for a true result.

          - **Check Count**: If the result satisfies the expression in check count, the result is true.

            ![image_1891](../images/1891.png)

      - Click **Registry** to create criteria based on registry values. For example, you can check whether DCOM is enabled on a Windows System. This applies only to Windows operating systems. Registry will only be available if you are creating a VM Condition.
