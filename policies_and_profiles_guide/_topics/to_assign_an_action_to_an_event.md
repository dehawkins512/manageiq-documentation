#### Assigning an Action to an Event

This procedure describes how to assign an action to an event.

1. Browse to menu: **Control > Explorer**.

2. Click the **Policies** accordion, and select the policy that you want to assign actions to.

3. From the **Events** area, click the description of the event you want to assign an action to.

4. Click ![image](../images/1847.png)**Configuration**, ![image](../images/1851.png)**Edit Actions for this Policy Event**.

5. Select all the appropriate actions from the **Available Actions** box, inside the **Order of Actions if ALL Conditions are True**. These are the actions that take place if the resources meet the Condition of the Policy.

    **Note:**

    Each selected action can be executed synchronously or asynchronously; synchronous actions will not start until the previous synchronous action is completed, and asynchronous action allows the next action to start whether the first action has completed or not. Also, at least one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server in the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} zone must have the notifier server role that is enabled for the trap to be sent.

6. Click the add button ![image](../images/1876.png), then:

      - Click the action, then click ![image](../images/1883.png)**Set selected Actions to Asynchronous** to make it asynchronous.

      - Click the action, then click ![image](../images/1884.png)**Set selected Actions to Synchronous** to make it synchronous. If creating a synchronous action, use the up and down arrows to identify in what order you want the actions to run.

7. Select all the actions from the appropriate **Available Actions** box, inside of the **Order of Actions if ANY Conditions are False**. These are the actions that take place if the resources do not meet the condition of the policy.

8. Click **Save**.
