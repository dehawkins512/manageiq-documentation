OpenSCAP is an auditing tool used for hardening the security of your
enterprise. This tool is built upon the knowledge and resources provided
by the many experienced security experts active in the upstream OpenSCAP
ecosystem. For more information about OpenSCAP, see
<https://www.open-scap.org/>.

{{ site.data.product.title }} now supports OpenSCAP. By default, {{ site.data.product.title }}
provides a built-in *OpenSCAP policy profile* which provides policies
for managing the security of your *container images*.

These policies ensure that new container images from any provider within
{{ site.data.product.title }} are scanned against the latest CVE content from Red Hat.
See Red Hatâ€™s [Security
Data](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/) page for more
details about this content. In particular, the [SCAP source data stream
files index](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds) provides
examples of security advisories used by the built-in OpenSCAP policy
profile.

Each of these security advisories have a severity ranging from **Low**
to **Critical**. With the built-in OpenSCAP policy profile, any image
that fails a security check against an advisory with at least a **High**
severity is marked as non-compliant.

The built-in OpenSCAP policy profile cannot be edited. You can, however,
edit copies of its policies and assign those copies to a new profile.
See [Creating a Customized OpenSCAP Policy Profile](#openscap-custom)
for more information.

#### Assigning the Built-In OpenSCAP Policy Profile

The OpenSCAP policy profile included with {{ site.data.product.title }} is not
automatically assigned. You still need to assign it to a container
provider. The method for doing so is similar to that of any normal
policy profile (as in [???](#profile-assign)):

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Containers \> Providers\], check the
    providers you need to assign the OpenSCAP policy profile to.

2.  Click ![image](../images/1941.png) (**Policy**), and then click
    ![image](../images/1851.png)(**Manage Policies**).

3.  From the **Select Policy Profiles** area, click on the triangle next
    to **OpenSCAP profile** to expand it and see its member policies.

4.  Check **OpenSCAP profile**. It turns blue to show its assignment
    state has changed.

5.  Click **Save**.

#### Scheduling an OpenSCAP Compliance Check on Container Images

Once you have assigned the built-in OpenSCAP policy profile to a
container provider, you can schedule a compliance check against the
policy profile. The method for doing is similar to that of scheduling a
normal compliance check ([???](#compliance-schedule)):

{% include_relative _topics/steps_schedule-compliance-check.md %}

1.  From the **Action** dropdown, select **Container Image Analysis**.

2.  From the **Filter** dropdown, select **All Container Images for
    Containers Provider**, a new dropdown will appear. From this
    dropdown, choose the provider where you enabled the OpenSCAP policy
    profile.

{% include_relative _topics/compliance_check_timer.md %}

### Creating a Customized OpenSCAP Policy Profile

The built-in OpenSCAP policy profile cannot be edited. You can, however,
assign *edited* copies of its policies to a new policy profile. This
will allow you to create a *customized* version of the built-in OpenSCAP
policy profile.

To do so, you will first have to copy the policy you want to customize:

{% include_relative _topics/copying_a_policy-steps.md %}

You can now edit the copied policy. For instructions on how to edit
policies, see:

  - [???](#policy-edit-basic)

  - [???](#policy-edit-condition-assignment)

  - [???](#policy-edit-event-assignment)

After editing copied policies, you can now add them to a new policy
profile. For instructions on how to create a new policy profile (and add
policies to it), see [???](#profiles-create).

Once you have a customized policy profile, you can assign it to a
container provider. See [???](#profile-assign) for instructions.
