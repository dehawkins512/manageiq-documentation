provider and the virtual machines it can access. Ensure the provider has
credentials to do this. If the providers were added using **Discovery**,
add credentials using ![Edit Selected Infrastructure

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Infrastructure \> Providers\].

2.  Select the providers to refresh.

    ![Refresh Relationships and Power States](../images/2003.png)
    (**Refresh Relationships and Power States**).

4.  Click **OK**.
