# Discovering Infrastructure Providers

In addition to individually adding providers, you can also discover
infrastructure providers in a given subnet range.

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Infrastructure \> Providers\].

2.  Click ![Configuration](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    click ![Discover Infrastructure Providers](../images/1942.png)
    (**Discover Infrastructure Providers**).

3.  Select the infrastructure provider to discover.

4.  Provide a **Subnet Range**. Enter the **From Address** and **To
    Address** of the address range.

5.  Click **Start**.

The appliance searches for all infrastructure providers in the specified
subnet range, and adds them to the user interface. However, before you
can manage providers added via discovery, you must edit each provider
and specify authentication details.
