# Containers Providers

A containers provider is a service that manages container resources, that can be added to the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance.

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} can connect to OpenShift Container Platform containers providers and manage them similarly to infrastructure and cloud providers. This allows you to gain control over different aspects of your containers environment and answer questions such as:

  - How many containers exist in my environment?

  - Does a specific node have enough resources?

  - How many distinct images are used?

  - Which image registries are used?

When {{ site.data.product.title_short }} connects to a containerâ€™s environment, it collects information on different areas of the environment:

  - Entities such as pods, nodes, or services.

  - Basic relationships between the entities, for example: Which services are serving which pods?

  - Advanced insight into relationships, for example: Which two different containers are using the same image?

  - Additional information, such as events, projects, routes, and metrics.

You can manage policies for containers entities by adding tags. All containers entities except volumes can be tagged.

**Note:**

This chapter provides details on managing containers providers. For details on working with the resources within a container environment, see [Container Entities](../managing_infrastructure_and_inventory/index.html#container-entities) in *Managing Infrastructure and Inventory*.

The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} user interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent containers providers. Each thumbnail contains four quadrants
by default, which display basic information about each provider:

1.  Number of nodes

2.  Container provider software

3.  Power state

4.  Authentication status

## Obtaining an OpenShift Container Platform Management Token

When deploying OpenShift using `openshift-ansible-3.0.20` (or later
versions), the OpenShift Container Platform [service account](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/authentication/understanding-and-creating-service-accounts.html)
and [roles](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/authentication/understanding-and-creating-service-accounts.html#service-accounts-granting-roles_understanding-service-accounts) required by {{ site.data.product.title_short }} are installed by default.

For newer versions of OpenShift you have to create a service-account with the proper permissions for {{ site.data.product.title_short }}.

1. Create a namespace for the service account
   ```
   project_name="management-manageiq" # Pick a name for your project
   oc adm new-project $project_name --description="ManageIQ Project"
   ```

2. Create a service account in that project
   ```
   service_account_name="management-admin"
   oc create serviceaccount $service_account_name -n $project_name
   ```

3. Create the cluster role
   ```
   echo '{"apiVersion": "v1", "kind": "ClusterRole", "metadata": {"name": "management-manageiq-admin"}, "rules": [{"resources": ["pods/proxy"], "verbs": ["*"]}]}' | oc create -f -
   ```

4. Apply roles and policies to the service account
   ```
   oc policy add-role-to-user -n $project_name admin -z $service_account_name
   oc policy add-role-to-user -n $project_name management-manageiq-admin -z $service_account_name
   oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:$project_name:$service_account_name
   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:$project_name:$service_account_name
   oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user self-provisioner system:serviceaccount:$project_name:$service_account_name
   ```

**Note:**

See the [OpenShift Container Platform documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/authentication/using-rbac.html#default-roles_using-rbac)
for a list of the default roles.

Run the following to obtain the token needed to add an OpenShift Container Platform provider:

    # oc sa get-token -n $project_name $service_account_name

## Enabling OpenShift Cluster Metrics

Use the OpenShift Cluster Metrics plug-in to collect node, pod, and container metrics into one location. This helps track usage and find common issues.

  - Configure {{ site.data.product.title_short }} to allow for all three [Capacity & Utilization server roles](../deployment_planning_guide/index.html#assigning-the-capacity-and-utilization-server-roles).

  - Enable cluster metrics using the [OpenShift Container Platform documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.5/html-single/installation_and_configuration/#install-config-cluster-metrics).
