# Viewing a Provider

From a list of providers, you can review a specific provider by clicking
on it. This displays various options to access provider information.

There are two methods of viewing an infrastructure provider’s details:
the summary screen (default) and the dashboard screen. Use the summary
![summary](../images/summary.png) and dashboard
![dashboard](../images/dashboard.png) buttons to toggle between views.

Both the summary and dashboard screens contain a taskbar with
**Reload**, **Configuration**, **Policy**, **Monitoring**, and
**Authentication** buttons to manage the selected provider.

**Provider Summary Screen.**
