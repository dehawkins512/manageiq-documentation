# Infrastructure Providers

In {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, an infrastructure provider is a virtual
infrastructure environment that you can add to a {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
appliance to manage and interact with the resources in that environment.
This chapter describes the different types of infrastructure providers
that you can add to {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, and how to manage them.
Infrastructure providers can be either discovered automatically by
{{ site.data.product.title_short }}, or added individually.

The web interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent infrastructure
providers. Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which
display basic information about each provider:

2.  Management system software

3.  Currently unused

4.  Authentication status

## Red Hat Virtualization Providers

To use a Red Hat Virtualization provider, add it to the appliance and
authenticate its hosts. You can also configure capacity and utilization
data collection to help track usage and find common issues.

## Microsoft SCVMM Providers

To use a Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)
provider, add it to the appliance and set up the SCVMM server for
authentication.

**Note:**

To use a SCVMM provider, you must have at least one network adapter available for communication between the host and the SCVMM management server. Make sure that **Used by Management** is checked for this network adapter in the SCVMM host properties.
