# Displaying Red Hat Satellite 6 Contents

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} provides two methods for viewing the contents of a Red
Hat Satellite 6 provider:

  - **Providers** - This presents the Red Hat Satellite 6 contents as a
    hierarchy of host groups belonging to a provider, and then
    individual hosts belonging to each provider.

  - **Configured Systems** - This presents a list of all hosts on your
    Red Hat Satellite 6 server. This also provides a method to apply
    predefined filters to organized specific machines.

Change between these two views using the accordion menu on the left of
the user interface.
