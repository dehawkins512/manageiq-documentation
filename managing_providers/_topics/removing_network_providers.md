# Removing Network Providers

Although network providers are added or removed automatically upon
adding or removing the respective cloud provider, you can manually
remove a network provider if it is no longer in use. This will remove
the network provider from the VMDB and any relationship with the cloud
provider.

1.  Navigate to menu:Networks\[Providers\].

2.  Click the network provider to remove.

3.  Click ![Configuration](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and
    then ![Remove this Network Provider from the VMDB](../images/2098.png)
    (**Remove this Network Provider from the VMDB**).

4.  Click **OK**.
