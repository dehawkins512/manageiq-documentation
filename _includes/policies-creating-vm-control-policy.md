1.  Navigate to menu:Control\[Explorer\].

2.  Expand the **Policies** accordion, and click **Control Policies**.

3.  Select **Vm Control Policies**.

4.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![image](../images/1862.png) (**Add a New VM and Instance Control
    Policy**).

5.  Enter a **Description**. This will be the name given to your VM
    control policy.

6.  Uncheck **Active** if you do not want this policy processed even
    when assigned to a resource.

7.  Optionally, enter **Scope** (you can also create a scope as part of
    a condition, or not use one at all). If the virtual machine is not
    included in the scope, the assigned action will not run.

    You can use the drop-down below the ![image](../images/1863.png)
    (**Commit expression element changes**) icon to create an expression
    for the **Scope**. {{ site.data.product.title_short }} will generate drop-downs
    containing relevant options depending on your choices. Click
    ![image](../images/1863.png) (**Commit expression element changes**)
    to add the scope.

8.  Enter **Notes** if required.

9.  Click **Add**. The policy is added and listed under **Vm Control
    Policies** in the **Policies** accordion.

10. Select the newly-added VM control policy. You can now associate
    events, conditions, and actions with the policy.

11. Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![image](../images/1851.png) (**Edit this Policyâ€™s Event
    assignments**).

12. Under **VM Operation**, select **VM Analysis Start**.

13. Click **Save**.

14. Click the **VM Analysis Start** event to configure actions.

15. Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![image](../images/1851.png) (**Edit Actions for this Policy Event**).

16. In **Order of Actions if ALL Conditions are True**, select the
    action created in [Creating an Action to Assign the Virtual Machine Analysis Profile to the Analysis Task](#assign-profile-analysis-task-action) from
    the **Available Actions** list. This action will take place if the
    resources meet the conditions of the policy.

    ![image](../images/edit-action.png)

    <div class="note">

    Each selected action can be executed synchronously or
    asynchronously; a synchronous action will not start until the
    previous synchronous action is completed, while an asynchronous
    action allows the next action to start whether or not the first
    action has completed. Also, at least one {{ site.data.product.title }} server in
    the {{ site.data.product.title }} zone must have the notifier server role enabled
    for the trap to be sent.

    </div>

17. Click (![image](../images/1876.png)) which will move the action to
    **Selected Actions**. The selected action is set to (S) Synchronous
    by default. From **Selected Actions**, select the action, then:

      - Click **A** (Set selected Actions to Asynchronous) to make it
        asynchronous.

      - Click **S** (Set selected Actions to Synchronous) to make it
        synchronous. If creating a synchronous action, use the up and
        down arrows to identify in what order you want the actions to
        run.

18. Click **Save**.
