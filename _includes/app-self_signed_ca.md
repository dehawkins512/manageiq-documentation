## Using a Self-Signed CA Certificate

Adding a self-signed Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for SSL authentication requires more configuration on OpenStack Platform and Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) providers.

**Note**: This procedure is not required for OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat Virtualization, or middleware manager providers, which have the option to select **SSL trusting custom CA** as a **Security Protocol** in the user interface. These steps are needed only for providers without this option in the user interface.

Before adding the provider, configure the following:

1. Copy your providerâ€™s CA certificate in PEM format to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` on your {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance.

2. Update the trust settings on the appliance:

        # update-ca-trust

3. Restart the EVM processes on the server:

        # rake evm:restart

The CA certificate is added to the appliance, and you can add the provider to {{ site.data.product.title_short }}.
