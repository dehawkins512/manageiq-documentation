You can output the results of an OpenSCAP scan of images to a report for
an overview of the security risk level of images. The **Images by Failed
OpenSCAP Rule Results** is included with {{ site.data.product.title_short }} and
shows whether the image has passed or failed OpenSCAP policy criteria,
and the security risk.
