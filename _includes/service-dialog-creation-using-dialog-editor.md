{{ site.data.product.title }} includes a drag-and-drop service dialog editor to create
service dialogs. The editor, with its drag-and-drop feature, provides a
visual representation of the components that comprise a service dialog.
You can easily design your service dialog utilizing dialog tabs,
sections (previously referred to as boxes), and elements.

When users access a service, the majority of options available to them
are preset and cannot be altered. The requirements for the service
determine the options and fields that need to be present in the dialog
for user input. A service dialog exposes some of those options to the
user so that even if they are ordering a basic Red Hat Enterprise Linux
7 machine, for example, they can at least choose the amount of memory,
virtual CPUs, or other options available to the instance they order. In
cases where certain fields must be unique, such as the name of virtual
machines in Red Hat Virtualization, users must enter their own unique
name for the virtual machine they choose or the operation will fail, so
this field must be exposed.

A service dialog contains three components:

  - One or more **Tabs**.

  - Inside the tabs, one or more **Sections**. Note that in the previous
    method of creating service dialogs using the {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
    user interface, **Sections** were referred to as **Boxes**.

  - Inside the sections, one or more **Elements**. Elements are controls
    that accept input. Elements contain methods, like check boxes,
    drop-down lists or text fields, to fill in the options on the
    provisioning dialog.

<div class="important">

The names of the elements must correspond to the options used in the
provisioning dialog.

        | Element Types | Additional Info                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
        | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
        | Text Area     | Provides text area for users to enter text. You can enter the default text in **Default Value**, or leave it as blank.                                                                                                                                                         |
        | Text Box      | Text box is similar to a text area with the added option to enable **Protected** so the text is shown as asterisks(\*), instead of plain text.                                                                                                                                 |
        | Check Box     | Enable **Default Value** if you want the box checked by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
        | Drop Down     | Use drop down to create list entries either manually or using automate methods. Enable **Dynamic** to create lists using automate methods; use **Entry Point** to select an automate instance. Enable **Show Refresh Button** to allow users to refresh list options manually. |
        | Radio Button  | Similar to a drop down but displays options using radio buttons.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
        | Datepicker    | Use this to enable users to pick a date by clicking the calendar icon.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
        | Timepicker    | use this to enable users to pick a date and time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
        | Tag Control   | Select a **Category** of tags you want assigned to virtual machines associated with the service dialog.

    2.  Enter a **Label**, **Name**, and **Description** for the
        element.

        <div class="important">

        Element names must correspond to the options used in the
        provisioning dialog. **Name** must use only alphanumeric
        characters and underscores without spaces. It is also used to
        retrieve the value of this element in the method used with the
        dialog and must start with **dialog\_service\_type**.

        </div>

    3.  Optional: Add additional information in **Help** to assist the
        user to complete the fields in the service dialog. This field is
        useful for explaining unfamiliar terminology or providing
        configuration tips. This information is presented when you hover
        over the \[\!\] exclamation mark in the Service Dialog while
        ordering a Service Catalog later.

    4.  Set other options as required.

    5.  Click **Save**.

8.  Optional: Repeat the above step to add more elements to the existing
    section, or create and add elements to a new section as required.

9.  Optional: Repeat the step to add a new tab to the dialog, and
    subsequent steps to add sections and elements to it as required.

10. Click **Save** to create the dialog.

The service dialog is now created, and added to the **Service Dialogs**
accordion.
