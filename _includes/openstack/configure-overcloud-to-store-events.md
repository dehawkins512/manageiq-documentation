By default, the Telemetry service does not store events emitted by other
services in a Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment. The following
procedure outlines how to enable the Telemetry service on your OpenStack
cloud provider to store such events. This ensures that events are
exposed to {{ site.data.product.title_short }} when a Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment
is added as a cloud provider.

1.  Log in to the undercloud host.

2.  Create an environment file called *ceilometer.yaml*, and add the
    following contents:

        parameter_defaults:
          CeilometerStoreEvents: true

3.  Please see the below **NOTE**.

If your OpenStack cloud provider was not deployed through the
undercloud, you can also set this manually. To do so:

1.  Log in to your Controller node.

2.  Edit */etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf*, and specify the following
    option:

        store_events = True

**Note:**

Passing the newly created environment file to the overcloud deployment is environment specific and requires executing commands in particular order depending on use of variables. For further information please see
[*Director Installation and Usage*](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/11/html/director_installation_and_usage/)
in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform documentation.
