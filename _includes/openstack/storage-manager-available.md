Two types of storage managers are currently available to
{{ site.data.product.title_short }}: OpenStack Block Storage (`openstack-cinder`) and
OpenStack Object Storage (`openstack-swift`). OpenStack Block Storage
provisions and manages block storage, whereas OpenStack Object Storage
manages object storage within the cloud. These storage managers are
discovered automatically by {{ site.data.product.title_short }} after adding an OpenStack
cloud provider.
