      - Use the **Interval** dropdown to select hourly or daily data
        points.

      - Use **Date** to type the date of the timeline to display.

      - If viewing a daily timeline, use **Show** to set how many days
        back to go. The maximum history is 31 days.

      - The three **Event Group** dropdowns allow selection of different
        event groups to display. Each has its own color.

      - From the **Level** dropdown, select either a **Summary** event
        or a **Detail** list of events. For example, the detail level of
        a **Power On** event might include the power on request, the
        starting event, and the actual **Power On** event. If you select
        **Summary**, you only see the **Power On** event in the
        timeline.

5.  To see more detail on an item in the timeline, click on it. A
    balloon appears with a clickable link to the resource.
