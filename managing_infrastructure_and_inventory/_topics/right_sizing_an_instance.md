{{ site.data.product.title }} uses collected statistics to recommend the best size for
an instance. {{ site.data.product.title }} uses the information from the **Normal
Operating Range** to calculate the recommendations.

2.  Click an instance for right-sizing.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then

Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive, next to the Normal Operating
Range statistics.
