# Right Sizing an Instance

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} uses collected statistics to recommend the best size for
an instance. {{ site.data.product.title_short }} uses the information from the **Normal
Operating Range** to calculate the recommendations.

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Clouds > Instances**.

2.  Click an instance for right-sizing.

3.  Click **Configuration**, and then
    ![2163](../images/2163.png) (**Right-Size Recommendations**) button.

A new page appears with three levels of Memory and CPU recommendations,
Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive, next to the Normal Operating
Range statistics.
