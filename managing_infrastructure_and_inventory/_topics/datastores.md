# Datastores

A storage location is considered a device where digital information
resides and is connected to a resource. {{ site.data.product.title_short }} detects,
analyzes, and collects capacity and utilization data for both VMFS and
NFS datastores. Datastores connected to a provider are automatically
created on discovery. On creation of a repository, a datastore is
automatically created.
