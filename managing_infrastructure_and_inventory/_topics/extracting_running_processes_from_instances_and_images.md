# Extracting Running Processes from Instances and Images

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} can collect processes running on Windows instances. To
do this, enter domain credentials for the zone where the instance is
located. The instance must be running and must have an IP address in the
VMDB, usually obtained from a SmartState Analysis.

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Clouds > Instances**.

2.  Click the checkboxes for the instances to collect processes.

3.  Click **Configuration**, and then
    ![2152](../images/2152.png)(**Extract Running Processes**) on the
    taskbar.

4.  Click **OK**.
