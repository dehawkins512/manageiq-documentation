### Adding an Interface to a Network Router

Interfaces allow you to interconnect routers with subnets. As a result,
the router can direct any traffic that instances send to destinations
outside of their intermediate subnet.

To add an interface to a network router:

1.  Navigate to menu:Networks\[Network Routers\].

2.  Select a network router from the list view.

3.  Click ![Configuration](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![Add Interface to this Router](../images/1851.png) (**Add Interface
    to this Router**).

4.  Select a **Subnet** from the list.

5.  Click **Add**.
