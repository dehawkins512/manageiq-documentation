# Key Pairs

This tab lists key pairs and fingerprints for all cloud providers. Click
on a key pair to see a summary and its relationship with instances. On
this screen, click on instances to see details of all instances the key
pair relates to. You can use the key pairs added during provisioning
instances.

**Note:**

Adding a new key pair is currently only supported for OpenStack.
