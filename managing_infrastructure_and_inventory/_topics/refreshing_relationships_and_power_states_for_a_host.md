# Refreshing Relationships and Power States for a Host

Refresh the relationships and power states of the items associated with
your hosts from the Host Taskbar.

**Note:**

`root` or administrator credentials are required to get patch
information.

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Infrastructure > Hosts**.

2.  Click on the host to refresh.

3.  Click **Configuration**, and then
    ![2003](../images/2003.png) (**Refresh Relationships and Power
    States**) on the Host Taskbar.

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} determines the state (running, stopped, or paused) of
all virtual machines registered to the host.
