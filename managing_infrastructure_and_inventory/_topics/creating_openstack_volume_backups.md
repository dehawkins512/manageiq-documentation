# Creating a Backup of a Volume

You can create a backup of a volume to protect against data loss, and
restore it in the future.

<div class="important">

For OpenStack Block Storage managers, the `openstack-cinder-backup`
service must be enabled on the OpenStack Block Storage manager to create a volume backup.

</div>

To create a backup of a volume:

{% include openstack/cinder-backup-create.md %}
