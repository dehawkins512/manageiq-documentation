# Analyzing Instances and Images with SmartState Analysis

Analyze an instance to collect metadata such as user accounts,
applications, software patches, and other internal information. If
{{ site.data.product.title }} is not set up for automatic analysis, perform a manual
analysis of an instance. To perform a SmartState Analysis,
{{ site.data.product.title }} requires a running SmartProxy with visibility to the
instanceâ€™s storage location so that a snapshot can be created.

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Clouds \> Instances\].

2.  Click the accordion for the items to analyze.

3.  Check the instances and images to analyze.

4.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1942](../images/1942.png) (**Perform SmartState Analysis**) on the
    taskbar.

5.  Click **OK**.

SmartState Analysis for instances runs as a process independent from
providers. For example, a successful SmartState Analysis of a host does
not mean SmartState Analysis for instances will be successful. Ensure to
enter credentials for the provider that contains the instance for the
