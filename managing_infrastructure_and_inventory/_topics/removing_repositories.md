# Removing Repositories

If a repository is decommissioned or requires troubleshooting, it might
require removal.

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Infrastructure > Repositories**.

2.  Check the repositories to remove.

3.  Click **Configuration**, and then
    ![1861](../images/1861.png) (**Remove from the VMDB**).

4.  Click **OK**.

The repositories are removed. Any virtual machines associated with the
repositories remain, but are no longer associated with their respective
repository. When removing a repository, the associated datastore
instance is not deleted.
