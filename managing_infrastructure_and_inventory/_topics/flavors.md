# Flavors

Flavors indicate the resource profiles available for instances. Each
flavor contains a value set for CPUs, CPU cores and memory. Flavors
allow you to pre-configure resource settings, which you can then apply
during instance provisioning. You can also change the flavor of a
provisioned instance; see [???](#_to_resize_an_instance_via_flavor) for
instructions.

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} provides the ability to view individual flavor
information and instances currently using the flavor.
