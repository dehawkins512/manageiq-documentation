# Host Virtual Summary

Clicking on a specific host shows the Hostâ€™s Virtual Thumbnail and an
`operating system-sensitive` screen of host information, called the Host
Summary. Where applicable, click on a subcategory of the Host Summary to
see more detail on that section.

A **Refresh** provides some basic information on the Host. To get more
detail, enter credentials for the host and perform a SmartState
Analysis.

The Summary divides into the following categories.

  - **Properties** include information such as base operating system,
    hostname, IP addresses, devices attached to the system, and storage
    adapters. Some categories can be clicked on for additional detail.
    For example, click **Network** to view the network adapters
    connected to the host.
