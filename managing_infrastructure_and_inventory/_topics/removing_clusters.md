# Removing Clusters

If a cluster has been decommissioned or requires troubleshooting, it
might require removal from the VMDB.

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Infrastructure > Clusters**.

2.  Check the clusters to remove.

3.  Click **Configuration**, and then
    ![1861](../images/1861.png) (**Remove Clusters from the VMDB**).

4.  Click **OK**.

The clusters are deleted. Any virtual machines or hosts associated with
these clusters remain, but are no longer associated with them.
