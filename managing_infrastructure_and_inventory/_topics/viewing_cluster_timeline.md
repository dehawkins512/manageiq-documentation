      - Use the **Interval** dropdown to select hourly or daily data
        points.

      - Use **Date** to type the date for the timeline to display.

      - If you select to view a daily timeline, use **Show** to set how
        many days back to go. The maximum history is 31 days.

      - The three **Event Group** dropdowns allow the selection of
        different groups of events to display. Each has its own color.

      - From the **Level** dropdown, select a **Summary** event if
        needed, or a **Detail** list of events. For example, the detail
        level of a *Power On* event might include the power on request,
        the starting event, and the actual **Power On** event. If you
        select **Summary**, the timeline only displays the Power On
        event.

5.  To see more detail on an item in the timeline, click on it. A
    balloon appears with a clickable link to the resource.
