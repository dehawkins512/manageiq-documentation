Through {{ site.data.product.title }}, you can perform a *Compute scale down* on a Red
Hat OpenStack infrastructure provider. This process involves decreasing
its Compute nodes used by an OpenStack infrastructure provider. Doing so
involves putting a Compute node into *maintenance mode* and removing it
from the provider afterwards. Once a node is in maintenance mode, it can
be repurposed (for examle, re-provision it as a Controller node),
repaired, or decommissioned altogether.

Before scaling down, evacuate or migrate any instances hosted on the
node you are removing. For instructions on either procedure, see
[???](#_to_live_migrate_an_instance) or
[???](#_to_evacuate_an_instance).

After migrating or evacuating instances from the node, set the node to
maintenance mode. To do so:

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Infrastructure \> Hosts\].

2.  Click the OpenStack compute node to be removed from the provider.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1851](../images/1851.png) (**Toggle Maintenance Mode**).

    <div class="note">

    This option can only be used with OpenStack providers with at least
    two Compute nodes.

    </div>

Repeat this procedure for every node you want to remove from the cloud
provider.

After setting a Compute node to maintenance mode, you can scale down its
provider:

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Infrastructure \> Providers\].

2.  Click the provider to be scaled down.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1851](../images/1851.png) (**Scale Down**).

4.  From the **Scale Infrastructure Provider Down** section, check the
    nodes to be removed from the provider. You can only do this for
    nodes where **Maintenance** is set to **true**.

5.  Click **Scale Down**.
