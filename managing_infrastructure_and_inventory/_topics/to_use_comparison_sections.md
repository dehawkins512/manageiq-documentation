# Using the Virtual Machine Comparison Sections

Use the comparison sections to view various comparison data and display
the data in different ways.

1.  On the left of a comparison screen, select what categories of
    properties to display.

2.  Click **Apply**.

3.  Click the plus sign next to the sections name to expand it.

4.  The following descriptions pertain to the **Expanded View**
    ![2023](../images/2023.png). Whether you see the value of a property
    or an icon representing the property depends on the properties type.

      - A property displayed in the same color as the base means that
        the compared virtual machine matches the base for that property.

      - A property displayed in a different color from the base means
        that the compared virtual machine does not match the base for
        that property.

5.  If you are in the **Compressed View** ![2024](../images/2024.png), the
    values of the properties will not be displayed. The icons shown
    below will describe all items.

      - A ![2150](../images/2150.png) (**checkmark**) means that the
        compared virtual machine matches the base for that property. If
        you hover over it, the value of the property will display.

      - A ![2151](../images/2151.png) (**x**) means that the compared
        virtual machine does not match the base for that property. If
        you hover over it, the value of the property will display.

6.  Click the minus sign next to the sections name to collapse it.

Your comparison can be viewed in multiple ways. Export the data or
create a report from your comparison for analysis using external tools.
