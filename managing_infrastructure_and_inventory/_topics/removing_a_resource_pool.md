# Removing a Resource Pool

If a resource pool is decommissioned or requires troubleshooting, it
might require removal from the VMDB.

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Infrastructure \> Resource Pools\].

2.  Click on the resource pool to remove.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1861](../images/1861.png) (**Remove from the VMDB**).

4.  Click **OK**.

The resource pool is removed. The virtual machines remain in the VMDB,
but are no longer associated with this resource pool.
