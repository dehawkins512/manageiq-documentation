# Removing a Resource Pool

If a resource pool is decommissioned or requires troubleshooting, it
might require removal from the VMDB.

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Infrastructure > Resource Pools**.

2.  Click on the resource pool to remove.

3.  Click **Configuration**, and then
    ![1861](../images/1861.png) (**Remove from the VMDB**).

4.  Click **OK**.

The resource pool is removed. The virtual machines remain in the VMDB,
but are no longer associated with this resource pool.
