# Extracting Running Processes from Virtual Machines and Templates

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} can collect processes running on Windows virtual
machines. To do this, enter domain credentials for the zone where the
virtual machine is located.

The virtual machine must be running and must have an IP address in the
VMDB, usually obtained from a SmartState Analysis.

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Infrastructure > Virtual Machines**.

2.  Check the Virtual Machines to collect the processes.

3.  Click **Configuration**, and then
    ![2152](../images/2152.png)(**Extract Running Processes**) on the
    Taskbar.

4.  Click **OK**.

The server returns the running processes. View the summary of the
virtual machine to see the details.
