# Removing Hosts

If a host is decommissioned or requires troubleshooting, it might
require removal from the VMDB.

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Infrastructure \> Hosts\].

2.  Check the hosts to remove.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1861](../images/1861.png) (**Remove items from the VMDB**).

4.  Click **OK**.

The hosts are removed. The virtual machines remain in the VMDB, but are
no longer associated with their respective hosts.
